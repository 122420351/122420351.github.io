<p>Rural GSM product focus on rural and remote places where infrastructure is unavailable,the main target market is isolated island &amp; undeveloped countryside like some places in India and Africa  .
Rural GSM is an normal GSM network including Radio Access Network and Core Network.But it's different from the traditional GSM network,especially for the Raido Access Network(RAN).A rural site may be short of power(only solar power is available),lack of backhaul connection and satellite maybe the only choice most of the time,low population,low ARPU,etc...All of these factors affect the RAN product.A Rural GSM ,here we mainly refer to RAN(BTS and BSC) should be easy deployment &amp; low cost &amp; high stability &amp; power saving &amp; bandwidth saving.</p>
